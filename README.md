Sift connects to Canvas, Google Calendar, Gmail, Slack, Notion, and more — giving students and professionals one AI assistant that tracks everything and helps them plan around it through natural conversation.

No tab-switching. No manual entry. Just text Sift what you need.

## What It Does

- **Syncs your academic life** — Canvas assignments, calendar events, Gmail, and more stay up to date automatically in the background.
- **Plans your day** — generates time-blocked schedules around your classes, deadlines, and preferences.
- **Works where you are** — chat on the web, over iMessage, or via SMS. Same AI, same context, every channel.
- **Remembers you** — learns your commitments, interests, habits, preferences, and goals so suggestions improve over time.
- **Automates the boring stuff** — daily briefings, deadline reminders, email triage, and smart notifications you can set up in plain English.
- **Manages your tasks** — create, prioritize, and track todos alongside Canvas assignments in one place.

### Highlights

**Hierarchical agent system** — A central orchestrator delegates to 10 specialized sub-agents (scheduling, email, memory, notes, tasks, etc.), each with isolated tool access. 100+ tools auto-registered at class definition time. Mid-processing message injection via Redis-backed steer signals lets users redirect the agent while it's still thinking.

**Native iMessage relay** — A custom Mac Mini HTTP relay (not a third-party wrapper) enables full bidirectional iMessage: chunked streaming with natural pacing, Gemini Vision for photo attachments, tapback reactions, per-user privacy isolation in group chats, and automatic SMS fallback via SignalWire.

**3-tier classifier** — Every inbound signal (email, calendar event, Canvas update) passes through a progressive classifier: keyword hash (~1ms) → embedding similarity via pgvector (~10ms) → Gemini Flash LLM (~500ms). Results above 0.80 confidence feed back into the cache, so repeated patterns get faster over time.

**18 background workers** — APScheduler jobs with Redis distributed locking, exponential backoff, and timeout enforcement. Handles calendar sync (down to 30s intervals), Canvas polling, reminder firing (~10s latency), entity graph decay, weather, email watch renewals, and more.

**Real-time streaming UI** — Token-by-token chat rendering with `requestAnimationFrame` buffering at 60fps. 22 message types (schedule drafts, email drafts, thinking blocks, workflow progress) rendered via polymorphic components. Socket.IO with offline buffering and 15-attempt exponential reconnection.

**Security stack** — 7 middleware layers including hierarchical rate limiting (4-level sliding window), Redis-backed idempotency, and request size gating. AES-256-GCM token encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation. Supabase Auth with row-level security on all tables.
